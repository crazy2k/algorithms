# `10-homework.py`

The main algorithm here is coded in the `question()` function. This function receeives a range `r` and a number `k` and it has to return how many of the numbers in that range have a primacity of exactly `k`.

The idea here was to go through each element of the range, one by one, and calculating its primacity. If the primacity was `k`, then this number was kept, otherwise, it was discarded.
